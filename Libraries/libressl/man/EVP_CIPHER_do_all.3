.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_do_all
calls
.Fa fn
on every entry of the global table of cipher names and aliases.
For a cipher name entry,
.Fa fn
is called with a non-NULL
.Fa cipher ,
its non-NULL cipher name
.Fa from ,
a NULL
.Fa to ,
and the
.Fa arg
pointer.
For an alias entry,
.Fa fn
is called with a NULL
.Fa cipher ,
its alias
.Fa from ,
the cipher name that alias points
.Fa to ,
and the
.Fa arg
pointer.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_do_all_sorted
is similar, except that it processes the cipher names and aliases
in lexicographic order of their
.Fa from
names as determined by
.Xr strcmp 3 .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_MD_do_all
calls
.Fa fn
on every entry of the global table of digest names and aliases.
For a digest name entry,
.Fa fn
is called with a non-NULL
.Fa md ,
its non-NULL digest name
.Fa from ,
a NULL
.Fa to ,
and the
.Fa arg
pointer.
For an alias entry,
.Fa fn
is called with a NULL
.Fa md ,
its alias
.Fa from ,
the digest name that alias points
.Fa to ,
and the
.Fa arg
pointer.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_MD_do_all_sorted
is similar, except that it processes the digest names and aliases
in lexicographic order of their
.Fa from
names as determined by
.Xr strcmp 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr evp 3 ,
.Xr EVP_add_cipher 3 ,
.Xr OBJ_NAME_do_all 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in OpenSSL 1.0.0 and have been available since
.Ox 4.9 .
.Sh BUGS
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_do_all_sorted
and
.Fn EVP_MD_do_all_sorted
are wrappers of
.Xr OBJ_NAME_do_all_sorted 3 .
In particular, if memory allocation fails, they do nothing at all
without telling the caller about the problem.
