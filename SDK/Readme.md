lib3mf is a C++ implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file standard.

It provides 3MF reading and writing capabilities, as well as conversion and validation tools for input and output data.
lib3mf runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS and offers a clean and easy-to-use API in
[various programming languages](https://lib3mf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#api-documentation)
to speed up the development and keep integration costs at a minimum.

As 3MF shall become an universal 3D Printing standard, its quick adoption is very important. 
This library shall lower all barriers of adoption to any possible user, let it be software 
providers, hardware providers, service providers or middleware tools.
