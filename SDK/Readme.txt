Lib3MF is a C++ implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file standard.

As 3MF shall become an universal 3D Printing standard, its quick adoption is very important. 
This library shall lower all barriers of adoption to any possible user, let it be software 
providers, hardware providers, service providers or middleware tools.
The specification can be downloaded at
[http://3mf.io/specification/](http://3mf.io/specification/)

Its aim is to offer an open source way to integrate 3MF reading and writing capabilities, as well 
as conversion and validation tools for input and output data. The 3MF Library shall provide a 
clean and easy-to-use API to speed up the development and keep integration costs at a minimum.
