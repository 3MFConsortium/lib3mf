There is a bash/batch script that updates the libraries and copies the header and source files to the respective Libraries folder.

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell/ Powershell environment
- Git installed

## Usage
To run the script, execute the following command:

.\update_libs.bat <library_name>

or 

bash update_libs.sh <library_name>
